## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

### Algorithm: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity

**1. Preprocessing:**
```
Raw Text → Lowercase → Tokenize → Remove Stopwords → Token Array
```

**2. TF-IDF Calculation:**
```
TF(term, doc) = count(term in doc) / total_tokens(doc)
IDF(term) = log(total_docs / docs_containing_term)
TF-IDF(term, doc) = TF × IDF
```

**3. Similarity Matching:**
```
Cosine Similarity = dot_product(query_vector, doc_vector) / 
                    (magnitude(query_vector) × magnitude(doc_vector))
```

**4. Vocabulary Size:** ~1,200-1,500 unique legal terms

**5. Performance:**
- **Index Build Time:** 1-2 seconds for 155 sections
- **Search Time:** <50ms per query
- **Memory Usage:** ~3-4MB (vectors + vocabulary)
- **IndexedDB Storage:** ~800KB

---

## 🔍 Search Capabilities

### 1. Section Number Search (Exact Match)
```
