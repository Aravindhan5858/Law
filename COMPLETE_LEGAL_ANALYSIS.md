- Seller is willing to pay immediately

**Negotiate for:**
- At least full refund + interest

## 7. IMPORTANT TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### 🔴 TIP 1: EVIDENCE IS EVERYTHING

**Without Evidence, Case is Weak:**
- No payment proof = can't prove you paid
- No order confirmation = can't prove there was agreement
- No communication = can't prove you followed up

**What Courts Accept:**
- Screenshots (with visible URL and date)
- Emails (with full headers)
- Bank statements (from bank, not UPI app)
- Affidavits (your sworn statement)
- Digital evidence (under IT Act, Section 65B certificate)

**How to Preserve:**
- Don't just screenshot phone - download emails
- Save to multiple locations (cloud, hard drive, pen drive)
- Print important documents
- Get emails notarized if possible

---

### ⚖️ TIP 2: MULTIPLE REMEDIES WORK BEST

**Don't Choose One - File All:**

1. **Consumer Complaint** (for refund + compensation)
2. **Criminal FIR** (for punishment + pressure)
3. **Chargeback** (for quick recovery if eligible)
4. **Platform complaint** (if marketplace involved)

**Why Multiple?**
- Different purposes (money vs punishment)
- Multiple pressure points
- Higher chance of success
- Parallel proceedings allowed

**They Don't Conflict:**
- Consumer court = civil remedy
- Criminal case = punishment
- Both can run together

---

### ✅ TIP 3: CONSUMER COURT IS YOUR BEST BET

**Why Consumer Court?**

**Advantages:**
1. **No court fee** (up to Rs. 1 lakh)
2. **Simple procedure** (can file online)
3. **Fast disposal** (6-12 months vs 3-5 years in civil court)
4. **High success rate** (75-85% for genuine cases)
5. **No lawyer needed** (though helpful)
6. **Compensation awards** (mental harassment)
7. **Interest on amount** (9-12% p.a.)
8. **Can file from home** (e-Daakhil portal)

**Disadvantages:**
1. Enforcement can be slow if seller doesn't comply
2. Limited jurisdiction (only consumer disputes)
3. Can't award imprisonment (only money)

**When to Choose Civil Court Instead:**
- Amount exceeds Rs. 2 crores
- Not a consumer transaction
- Need injunction immediately

**For Your Case: Consumer Court is PERFECT**

---

### 💳 TIP 4: CHARGEBACK IS FASTEST (If Eligible)

**If You Paid by Credit Card:**

**Timeline:**
- File chargeback: Today
- Bank investigates: 30-45 days
- Money refunded: 60-90 days
- **Total: 2-3 months** (vs 6-12 months in court!)

**Success Rate:**
- With proof of non-delivery: **70-80%**
- Without proof: **30-40%**

**Important:**
- Don't wait for court - file immediately
- Time limit is 60-180 days from transaction
- Even if chargeback fails, you can still go to court
- Some banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI) are more helpful

**If Paid by UPI/Bank Transfer:**
- Chargeback not available
- Report to your bank anyway
- File cyber crime complaint
- Proceed with consumer court

---

### ⏰ TIP 5: ACT FAST - LIMITATION PERIODS

**Consumer Protection Act:**
- **2 years** from "cause of action"
- Cause of action = when you discovered deficiency
- For your case: When product not delivered on promised date
- **Don't delay!**

**IPC Offenses:**
- Section 420, 406: **3 years** from discovery of fraud
- Calculated from when you realized it was fraud (not when you paid)

**Contract Act:**
- **3 years** from breach of contract

**Practical Advice:**
- File within 3-6 months for best results
- Evidence becomes stale over time
- Website may disappear
- Seller may shut down
- Act NOW!

### 💰 TIP 9: COMPENSATION IS REAL

**Mental Harassment Compensation:**

Courts DO award compensation. It's not symbolic.

**Typical Awards:**
- Small harassment (Rs. 5,000-10,000 amount): Rs. 5,000-15,000
- Medium (Rs. 10,000-50,000 amount): Rs. 10,000-25,000
- Large (Rs. 50,000+ amount): Rs. 25,000-50,000
- Severe cases: Rs. 50,000-1,00,000

**Factors That Increase Compensation:**
- Multiple follow-ups ignored
- Rude behavior by seller
- Seller made false promises repeatedly
- Long duration of harassment
- Financial hardship caused
- Urgent need for product

**How to Claim:**
In your complaint, mention:
- How many times you contacted
- Mental stress caused
- Time wasted
- Opportunity lost
- Ask specific amount (Rs. 25,000-40,000)

---

### 🎯 TIP 10: SETTLEMENT IS OFTEN BEST

**Consider Settlement If:**
- Seller offers 80-100% recovery
- Quick payment (within 30 days)
- Saves 6-12 months of court time
- You get consent order from court

**How to Negotiate:**

**Don't Accept First Offer:**
- Seller offers refund only → Demand interest + compensation
- Seller offers 50% → Counter with 100% + Rs. 20,000
- Seller wants time → Max 30 days, or refuse

**Get It in Writing:**
- Settlement agreement signed
- File in court as "consent terms"
- Court passes order on agreed terms
- If seller doesn't pay → Execute court order

**Ideal Settlement:**
- Full refund (100%)
- Interest (6-12%)
- Some compensation (Rs. 10,000-20,000)
- Immediate payment
- Total: 120-150% recovery

**Better Than:**
- Waiting 12 months for court order
- Uncertainty of execution
- Stress of hearings
